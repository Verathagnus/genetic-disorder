In this model pandas, numpy and sklearn libraries were used.
First, the datasets are read using pandas
Then the numeric and categorical columns were found
The NaN values in numeric columns were replaced with mean and in categorical columns with mode
Then, Label Encoding is done on the 2 output columns
One Hot Encoding os performed on the other categorical columns and new columns are generated and the original columns along with the first column is dropped.
Then, the feature columns for train and test and target columns for train were selected by index
These were then selected by using iloc function as array
Then, we performed Logistic Regression, KNN and Decision Tree Models for comparison
We used MultiOutputRegressor for multicolumn output to facilitate training
We got the predicted values for each model.
Then the dataset is reloaded to get the inverse transform for each model.
Then the results were stored in the required format in a csv file for each model and uploaded. 
The results were submitted and the Decision Tree was found to have the highest score.
